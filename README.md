Act vagrant box
===============

This box is based on the oficial Ubuntu lucid32 with current
Act version installed to help developing it.

This project is trying to automate the build of the vagrant box
from scratch. It's not finished yet. However, you can already
use a vagrant box that I managed to build manually. See
[vagrant cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/alexm/Act) for details.

You can use this project to report any issues for that box too.
